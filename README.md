pimpmylocalhost
===============

Pimp my Locahhost is a free php code that will jazz-up your boring list of files in the localhost with an exciting iOS7 style iconography.

Just download and install the index.php in the root folder of your localhost, accompanied by an "index" folder that contains the icons for folders and files.

Enjoy!
